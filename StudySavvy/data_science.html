		<h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">What is data science?</h1>
        <img src="Data-Science-ROI-7-Ways-to-Boost-It-2048x882.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and 
            machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. 
            These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field 
            across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest job of 
            the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review (link resides outside of IBM). Organizations are increasingly reliant on them 
            to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. 
            Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages:
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Data ingestion:</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            The lifecycle begins with the data collection--both raw structured and unstructured data from all relevant sources using a 
            variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and 
            devices. Data sources can include structured data, such as customer data, along with unstructured data like log files, 
            video, audio, pictures, the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and more.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Data storage and data processing: </h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to consider different storage systems based on the 
            type of data that needs to be captured. Data management teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, 
            which facilitate workflows around analytics, machine learning and deep learning models. This stage includes cleaning data, 
            deduplicating, transforming and combining the data using ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs or other data integration 
            technologies. This data preparation is essential for promoting data quality before loading into a data warehouse, data 
            lake, or other repository.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Data analysis:</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, ranges, and distributions of 
            values within the data. This data analytics exploration drives hypothesis generation for a/b testing. It also allows 
            analysts to determine the data’s relevance for use within modeling efforts for predictive analytics, machine learning, 
            and/or deep learning. Depending on a model’s accuracy, organizations can become reliant on these insights for business 
            decision making, allowing them to drive more scalability.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Communicate:</h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the insights—and their impact on 
            business—easier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand. A data science programming language such as 
            R or Python includes components for generating visualizations; alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization 
            tools.
        </p>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Data science versus data scientist</h1>
        <img src="pexels-christina-morillo-1181354.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Data science is considered a discipline, while data scientists are the practitioners within that field. Data scientists are 
            not necessarily directly responsible for all the processes involved in the data science lifecycle. For example, data 
            pipelines are typically handled by data engineers—but the data scientist may make recommendations about what sort of data 
            is useful or required. While data scientists can build machine learning models, scaling these efforts at a larger level 
            requires more software engineering skills to optimize a program to run more quickly. As a result, it’s common for a data 
            scientist to partner with machine learning engineers to scale machine learning models.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Data scientist responsibilities can commonly overlap with a data analyst, particularly with exploratory data analysis and 
            data visualization. However, a data scientist’s skillset is typically broader than the average data analyst. Comparatively 
            speaking, data scientist leverage common programming languages, such as R and Python, to conduct more statistical inference 
            and data visualization.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            To perform these tasks, data scientists require computer science and pure science skills beyond those of a typical business 
            analyst or data analyst. The data scientist must also understand the specifics of the business, such as automobile manufacturing, 
            eCommerce, or healthcare.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">In short, a data scientist must be able to:</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            -Know enough about the business to ask pertinent questions and identify business pain points.<br>
            -Apply statistics and computer science, along with business acumen, to data analysis.<br>
            -Use a wide range of tools and techniques for preparing and extracting data—everything from databases and SQL to data mining to data integration methods.<br>
            -Extract insights from big data using predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning models, natural language processing, and deep learning.<br>
            -Write programs that automate data processing and calculations.<br>
            -Tell—and illustrate—stories that clearly convey the meaning of results to decision-makers and stakeholders at every level of technical understanding.<br>
            -Explain how the results can be used to solve business problems.<br>
            -Collaborate with other data science team members, such as data and business analysts, IT architects, data engineers, and application developers.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            These skills are in high demand, and as a result, many individuals that are breaking into a data science career, 
            explore a variety of data science programs, such as certification programs, data science courses, and degree programs 
            offered by educational institutions.
        </p>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Data science versus business intelligence</h1>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            It may be easy to confuse the terms “data science” and “business intelligence” (BI) because they both relate to an 
            organization’s data and analysis of that data, but they do differ in focus.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Business intelligence (BI) is typically an umbrella term for the technology that enables data preparation, data mining, 
            data management, and data visualization. Business intelligence tools and processes allow end users to identify actionable 
            information from raw data, facilitating data-driven decision-making within organizations across various industries. While 
            data science tools overlap in much of this regard, business intelligence focuses more on data from the past, and the 
            insights from BI tools are more descriptive in nature. It uses data to understand what happened before to inform a course 
            of action. BI is geared toward static (unchanging) data that is usually structured. While data science uses descriptive 
            data, it typically utilizes it to determine predictive variables, which are then used to categorize data or to make 
            forecasts
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Data science and BI are not mutually exclusive—digitally savvy organizations use both to fully understand and extract value 
            from their data.
        </p>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Data science and cloud computing</h1>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Cloud computing scales data science by providing access to additional processing power, storage, and other tools required for 
            data science projects.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Since data science frequently leverages large data sets, tools that can scale with the size of the data is incredibly 
            important, particularly for time-sensitive projects. Cloud storage solutions, such as data lakes, provide access to storage 
            infrastructure, which are capable of ingesting and processing large volumes of data with ease. These storage systems 
            provide flexibility to end users, allowing them to spin up large clusters as needed. They can also add incremental compute 
            nodes to expedite data processing jobs, allowing the business to make short-term tradeoffs for a larger long-term outcome. 
            Cloud platforms typically have different pricing models, such a per-use or subscriptions, to meet the needs of their end 
            user—whether they are a large enterprise or a small startup.
        </p>
        <img src="dataimg.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Open source technologies are widely used in data science tool sets. When they’re hosted in the cloud, teams don’t need to 
            install, configure, maintain, or update them locally. Several cloud providers, including IBM Cloud®, also offer prepackaged 
            tool kits that enable data scientists to build models without coding, further democratizing access to technology 
            innovations and data insights. 
        </p>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Data science use cases</h1>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Enterprises can unlock numerous benefits from data science. Common use cases include process optimization through 
            intelligent automation and enhanced targeting and personalization to improve the customer experience (CX). However, 
            more specific examples include:
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Here are a few representative use cases for data science and artificial intelligence:
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
