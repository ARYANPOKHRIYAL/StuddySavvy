            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">Big data analytics uses advanced analytics on large collections of both structured and unstructured data to produce valuable insights for businesses. It is used widely across industries as varied as health care, education, insurance, artificial intelligence, retail, and manufacturing to understand what’s working and what’s not, to improve processes, systems, and profitability.</p>

            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">In this guide, you'll learn more about what big data analytics is, why it's important, and its benefits for many different industries today. You'll also learn about types of analysis used in big data analytics, find a list of common tools used to perform it, and find suggested courses that can help you get started on your own data analytics professional journey.</p>
            <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">What is Big Data Analytics?</h1>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">Big data analytics is the process of collecting, examining, and analyzing large amounts of data to discover market trends, insights, and patterns that can help companies make better business decisions. This information is available quickly and efficiently so that companies can be agile in crafting plans to maintain their competitive advantage.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">Technologies such as business intelligence (BI) tools and systems help organizations take the unstructured and structured data from multiple sources. Users (typically employees) input queries into these tools to understand business operations and performance. Big data analytics uses the four data analysis methods to uncover meaningful insights and derive solutions.</p>
            <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Example of big data analytics</h1>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">For example, big data analytics is integral to the modern health care industry. As you can imagine, thousands of patient records, insurance plans, prescriptions, and vaccine information need to be managed. It comprises huge amounts of structured and unstructured data, which can offer important insights when analytics are applied. Big data analytics does this quickly and efficiently so that health care providers can use the information to make informed, life-saving diagnoses. </p>
            <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Why is big data analytics important? </h1>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">Big data analytics is important because it helps companies leverage their data to identify opportunities for improvement and optimization. Across different business segments, increasing efficiency leads to overall more intelligent operations, higher profits, and satisfied customers. Big data analytics helps companies reduce costs and develop better, customer-centric products and services.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">Data analytics helps provide insights that improve the way our society functions. In health care, big data analytics not only keeps track of and analyzes individual records, but plays a critical role in measuring COVID-19 outcomes on a global scale. It informs health ministries within each nation’s government on how to proceed with vaccinations and devises solutions for mitigating pandemic outbreaks in the future. </p>
