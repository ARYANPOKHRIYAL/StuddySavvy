        <img src="pexels-alex-knight-2599244.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            While a number of definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) have surfaced over the last few decades, John McCarthy 
            offers the following definition in this 2004 paper (PDF, 106 KB) (link resides outside IBM),<i> " It is the science and 
            engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task 
            of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically 
            observable."</i>
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            However, decades before this definition, the birth of the artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's 
            seminal work, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (PDF, 89.8 KB) (link resides outside of IBM), which was published in 1950. 
            In this paper, Turing, often referred to as the "father of computer science", asks the following question, "Can machines think?" 
             From there, he offers a test, now famously known as the "Turing Test", where a human interrogator would try to distinguish 
             between a computer and human text response. While this test has undergone much scrutiny since its publish, it remains an 
             important part of the history of AI as well as an ongoing concept within philosophy as it utilizes ideas around linguistics.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
            Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig then proceeded to publish, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (link resides outside IBM), 
            becoming one of the leading textbooks in the study of AI. In it, they delve into four potential goals or definitions of AI, 
            which differentiates computer systems on the basis of rationality and thinking vs. acting:
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">Human approach:</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">-Systems that think like humans</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">-Systems that act like humans</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">Ideal approach:</p>
            
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">-Systems that think rationally</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">-Systems that act rationally</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                <i>Alan Turing’s definition would have fallen under the category of “systems that act like humans.”</i>
            </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable 
                problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in 
                conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems 
                which make predictions or classifications based on input data.
            </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                Today, a lot of hype still surrounds AI development, which is expected of any new emerging technology in the market. 
                As noted in Gartner’s hype cycle (link resides outside IBM), product innovations like, self-driving cars and personal 
                assistants, follow “a typical progression of innovation, from overenthusiasm through a period of disillusionment to an 
                eventual understanding of the innovation’s relevance and role in a market or domain.” As Lex Fridman notes here 
                (01:08:05) (link resides outside IBM) in his MIT lecture in 2019, we are at the peak of inflated expectations, 
                approaching the trough of disillusionment.  
            </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                As conversations emerge around the ethics of AI, we can begin to see the initial glimpses of the trough of disillusionment.

            <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Types of artificial intelligence—weak AI vs. strong AI</h1>
            <img src="pexels-lj-2085831.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                Weak AI—also called Narrow AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)—is AI trained and focused to perform specific 
                tasks. Weak AI drives most of the AI that surrounds us today. ‘Narrow’ might be a more accurate descriptor for this type 
                of AI as it is anything but weak; it enables some very robust applications, such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, 
                IBM Watson, and autonomous vehicles.
            </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                Strong AI is made up of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). 
                Artificial general intelligence (AGI), or general AI, is a theoretical form of AI where a machine would 
                have an intelligence equaled to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to 
                solve problems, learn, and plan for the future. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)—also known as 
                superintelligence—would surpass the intelligence and ability of the human brain. While strong AI is still entirely 
                theoretical with no practical examples in use today, that doesn't mean AI researchers aren't also exploring its 
                development. In the meantime, the best examples of ASI might be from science fiction, such as HAL, the superhuman, 
                rogue computer assistant in 2001: A Space Odyssey.

             <h1 style="color: rgb(11, 220, 35);">Artificial intelligence applications</h1>
             <img src="pexels-kindel-media-8566473.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
             <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                There are numerous, real-world applications of AI systems today. Below are some of the most common examples:
             </p>
             <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Speech recognition:</h3>
             <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a 
                capability which uses natural language processing (NLP) to process human speech into a written format. Many mobile 
                devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search—e.g. Siri—or provide more 
                accessibility around texting. 
             </p>
             <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Customer service: </h3>
             <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                Online virtual agents are replacing human agents along the customer journey. They answer frequently asked questions 
                (FAQs) around topics, like shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for 
                users, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and social media platforms. Examples include 
                messaging bots on e-commerce sites with virtual agents, messaging apps, such as Slack and Facebook Messenger, and tasks 
                usually done by virtual assistants and voice assistants.
             </p>
             <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Computer vision: </h3>
             <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                This AI technology enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and 
                other visual inputs, and based on those inputs, it can take action. This ability to provide recommendations 
                distinguishes it from image recognition tasks. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has 
                applications within photo tagging in social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving cars within the 
                automotive industry.  
             </p>
             <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">-Recommendation engines:</h3>
             <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more 
                effective cross-selling strategies. This is used to make relevant add-on recommendations to customers during the 
                checkout process for online retailers.
             </p>
             <h3 style="color: rgb(11, 171, 51);">Automated stock trading:</h3>
             <p style="color: rgb(243, 247, 244);">
                Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of 
                trades per day without human intervention.
